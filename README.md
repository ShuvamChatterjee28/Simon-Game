Simon is originally an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

This game is an online simulation of the original game, in which you have to see the sequence of lights in the screen and follow the exact sequence as shown to continue playing the error. Once you mess up the sequence, the game will end. Why waiting? Try it out!
